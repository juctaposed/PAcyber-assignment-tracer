## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js

Everything on the page is a component - which was a great exercise in thought as to what else can actually be molded into components. Using the State hook made handling changes to each of these components throughout the entire user interaction with the application a breeze. 

## Optimizations:

Given that this app is all about creating a pleasant user experience, adding additional themes and more in depth functionality such as notes for individual tasks, etc. are on the backlog

## Lessons Learned:

This was an eye-opener compared to building similar apps with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Prior to working with React I was separating concerns based on content, styling, and behavior. I had even developed projects utilizing MVC structure, which separates concerns for backend development. React is a little different because it's possible to abstract functionality, styling, and content into these specific objects or components where all of the relevant logic is housed in a readable manner. By implementing React on this app I learned it wasn't necessarily important how you separate these concerns, but that you do so in a way that makes adding new functionality and collaboration easy. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Install dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
